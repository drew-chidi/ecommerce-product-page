## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have deeper understanding of how to use negative margins, flexbox and positions.

### Continued development

I will read up on the style property, position, and I look forward to working on projects where I will apply positioning.

### Useful resources

- [How to use CSS Media Query Breakpoint in Styled-Components](https://dev.to/cagatayunal/how-to-use-css-media-query-breakpoint-in-styled-components-9of) - This helped me to apply media queries to the project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
